# BoardGameDB

This is a project I completed as part of an 8 week Introduction to Data and SQL with Code First Girls. I completed the course as Project Winner and as a Highly Commended Candidate.

The project was completed in MySQL, in which I created and queried a database. As an avid board gamer, I chose to create a database that could be used in a board game shop. 

The core project requirements were:
- create a relational DB of your choice with a minimum of 5 tables
- set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between tables
- using any type of joins, create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
- in your DB, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
- prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
- create a DB diagram where all table relations are shown

The advanced options were:
- in your DB, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
- in your DB, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
- in your DB, create an event and demonstrate how it runs
- create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses this view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis
- prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
